Action on Climate in Teignbridge aims to help people and organisations across Teignbridge (Devon, UK) to cut their carbon emissions and improve or restore ecosystems.
We provide support and information to councils, individuals, community groups and other organisations working to become carbon neutral and help wildlife flourish.

As part of that activity we have developed a website, which has several applications. 
This repository contains some of these applications.
